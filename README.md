# pyralite
JavaScript addon, mostly just some useful functions and readability improvements for JS <br>
There's an official server for projects by me and [@Litleck](https://github.com/Litleck), here: https://discord.gg/rXVnuTB <br>
Feel free to open issues for suggestions, bugs, or questions, or open a pull request for additions.
## Usage

<script src='pyralite-x.x .js'></script>
